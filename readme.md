### ML for categorizing messages during a disaster

This is a webapp which can automatically categorize text messages according to their relationship to a disaster that is happening. It also provides some summary information about the types of messages which are sent as a disaster is happening. This code has been developed as part of the "Data Scientist Nanodegree Program" with Udacity. Data have been provided to Udacity from [Appen](https://www.figure-eight.com/).
